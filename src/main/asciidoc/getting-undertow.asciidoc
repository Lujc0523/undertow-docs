=== Getting Undertow

There are a few ways to get Undertow.

==== Wildfly

Since version 8.0 Undertow has been the web server component of link:http://wildfly.org[Wildfly]. If you are using Wildfly
then you already have Undertow.

==== Maven

Undertow is built using maven, and is synced to maven central. Undertow provides three separate artifacts:

Core:: Undertow core, which provides support for non blocking handlers and web sockets
Servlet:: Support for Servlet 4.0
Websockets JSR:: Support for the 'Java API for Websockets (JSR-356)' standard

In order to use Undertow in your maven projects just include the following section in your pom.xml, and set the `undertow.version`
property to whatever version of Undertow you wish to use. Only the core artifact is required, if you are not using
Servlet or JSR-356 then those artifacts are not required.

==== Direct Download

Undertow can also be directly downloaded from the link:http://mvnrepository.com/search?q=io.undertow[maven repository].

Undertow depends on link:http://xnio.jboss.org[XNIO] and link:https://github.com/jboss-logging/jboss-logging[JBoss Logging],
which will need to be downloaded as well.

==== Build it yourself

In order to get the most up to date code you can build Undertow yourself.

*Prerequisites*

- JDK8 or higher
- Maven 3.1
- git

Building Undertow is easy, just follow these steps:

Configure Maven::
Follow the instructions link:https://developer.jboss.org/wiki/MavenGettingStarted-Users[here] to configure Maven to use
the JBoss Maven repository.

Clone the git repo::
`git clone https://github.com/undertow-io/undertow.git`

Build Undertow::
`cd undertow && mvn install`

The build should run all tests and complete without errors.

[WARNING]
If you attempt to build with `-Dmaven.test.skip=true` for your initial build the build will fail, as the core test
jar will not be built and the Servlet module has a test scoped dependency on this jar. Either use `-DskipTests`, or
just let the tests run the first time.
